## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Exceptionally Well

1. **Structured Prompts with Context**: Providing specific file paths, error messages, and code snippets resulted in highly accurate suggestions
2. **Iterative Refinement**: Multiple rounds of prompt-validate-refine improved quality significantly
3. **Phase-Based Development**: Following logical development phases (kernel → user apps → scripts → docs) allowed focused AI assistance
4. **Validation-First Mindset**: Testing every AI suggestion before integration prevented issues
5. **Documentation as Collaboration**: Using AI for documentation structure while maintaining technical accuracy worked excellently

### What Required Significant Human Oversight

1. **Kernel API Currency**: Some AI suggestions referenced older kernel APIs; required validation against current kernel version
2. **Hardware-Specific Details**: Device tree bindings and platform-specific code needed manual verification
3. **Performance Tuning**: AI suggested approaches, but actual optimization required measurement on real hardware
4. **Locking Strategy**: While AI explained concepts well, final locking design required deep understanding of driver requirements
5. **Error Handling Edge Cases**: Comprehensive error handling required thinking beyond AI suggestions

### AI Limitations Encountered

1. **No Direct Execution**: Cannot run code, load modules, or test on hardware
2. **Context Window Limits**: Large files sometimes required splitting into multiple prompts
3. **Platform Assumptions**: Often defaulted to x86_64; needed explicit ARM64 corrections
4. **Temporal Knowledge**: Some kernel API suggestions from older kernel versions (5.x vs 6.x)
5. **Cannot Access Filesystem**: Works from code excerpts, not full project context

### Best Practices Developed

1. **Always Validate**: Never integrate AI-generated code without compilation and testing
2. **Request Rationale**: Ask "why" to understand the reasoning, not just "what" to implement
3. **Provide Comprehensive Context**: Share challenge requirements, constraints, and target platform details
4. **Iterate in Small Steps**: Make incremental changes, test each, then proceed
5. **Document Everything**: Record all prompts and validations for honest disclosure
6. **Cross-Reference**: Verify AI suggestions against official documentation and kernel source
7. **Test on Real Hardware**: Simulator/emulator testing insufficient for driver development
